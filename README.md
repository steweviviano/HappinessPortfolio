# HappinessPortfolio
This portfolio has been realized as an university project for the course "Data Analytics for Finance I & II" held at USI (Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana). My biggest thanks go to Professor Peter Gruber for the lessons he gave us, for the critical sense he taught us, and for the guidelines that allowed us to approach this delivery with great freedom and creativity.
